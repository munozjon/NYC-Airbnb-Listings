# NYC AIRBNB LISTING
Project 3

Overview

This project analyzes and creates visualizations about Airbnb listings in New York City to gain comprehensive insights into the market. Our main objective is to provide a detailed breakdown of listings across the city's five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. We also aim to offer comparative analyses on various aspects, including pricing, amenities, and location distribution.

Motivation and Purpose

This project is driven by the surging popularity of Airbnb as a lodging option, leading to a critical need for accurate, accessible data to guide users through the market. Our objective is to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb listings in New York City to:

1.	Assist Potential Renters: Provide detailed information on listing prices, available amenities, and neighborhood characteristics to help users make informed decisions about renting.

2.	Support Researchers and Policy Makers: Provide a reliable dataset and insights for academic research or policy making, especially in urban development, housing, and tourism.

3.	Enhance Market Transparency: By analyzing the data into more detailed insights, we aim to improve the overall transparency of the Airbnb market in New York City.

The project involves several key areas:

Data Collection:
The primary dataset is sourced from Inside Airbnb, providing comprehensive information on Airbnb listings, including geographic coordinates, neighborhood details, pricing, and amenities.

Data Processing and Cleaning:
We meticulously process and clean the data to ensure accuracy and relevance, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and providing up-to-date information.

Data Visualization:
We use advanced visualization tools to create interactive maps and charts, enabling users to explore the data intuitively. These visualizations highlight key metrics such as average prices per borough, amenity availability, and the spatial distribution of listings.

Comparative Analysis:
We conduct comparative analyses across different boroughs to identify trends and patterns, compare average rental prices, examine amenity distribution, and analyze geographical spread within each borough. Key Insights and Findings


Through our analysis, we have discovered several intriguing insights:

Price Variations: There are significant variations in average rental prices across different boroughs and neighborhoods.

Amenity Distribution: We have gained insights into the most common amenities offered in different listings, and their availability varies by location.

Location Trends: We have identified patterns in the density of listings and how this correlates with factors such as proximity to tourist attractions or business districts.

By providing these insights, we aim to contribute valuable information to the community and support more informed decision-making for all future renters involved.
